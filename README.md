# SpringbootAPIsWithoutDB

## Part 2

*This is Part 2 of a series of Github repository pushes that I had started, last week, to learn new things (primarily Java and Python, and a little bit of Node.js if time permits) and keep up with what I have already learnt.*

This is a very simple project where there are APIs to create, read (individual and the whole list), update and delete a single student.

Ideally, this would have been done in an SQL table(s), but wanted to try it out writing to the in-built H2 database that Spring provides.

Changes to this particular project will be made over time, to add error handling and allow for querying using studentName (for CRUD).

## Steps to run the code:

*mvn spring-boot:run*
